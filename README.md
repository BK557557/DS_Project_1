## Analysing an Airbnb dataset

## Installations

Python version 3
NumPy library
Pandas library
Matplotlib.pyplot library
Seaborn library

## Project Motivation

This is a a sneak peek into the Airbnb activity in Seattle, WA, USA.
The motivation behind this project was to better understand burning questions I had in mind. What is the average listing price in Seattle's Airbnb scene? What are the most popular neighbourhoods? How do they vary by property type? and many more.

## File Description

There is 1 notebook shared here with all the analysis & key findings. There were 3 original CSV files with the data fragmented across them, and I used each one as need be. Those are attached as well in zipped files.
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results

The main findings of the analysis can be found at the post which is linked [here](https://medium.com/@bashar.khaddage/exploring-seattles-airbnb-scene-a66f145c836f)
